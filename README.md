# PictureSegmentation

Picture Segmentation using Deep Learning Models
This project demonstrates picture segmentation using deep learning techniques, including models like DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0. The dataset used is from the COCO dataset, focusing on food categories such as donuts, pizza, and cake. The segmentation process is applied using mask annotations to predict object categories within images.

Key Features
COCO Dataset Integration: Downloads and processes images from the COCO dataset.
Image Segmentation: Implements image segmentation using convolutional neural networks.
Model Architectures: Three different pre-trained models (DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0) are fine-tuned for segmentation tasks.
Training and Evaluation: Models are trained and validated using categorical cross-entropy and accuracy metrics.
Visualization: Results are visualized by comparing the original image, the ground truth mask, and the predicted mask.
